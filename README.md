The game you are about to play, is an obstacles avoiding game. Press spacebar once to jump, and twice to double jump. The game will take you back to an 80s arcade feel, 
with its blue and red colors, its 8-bit music, and level progression sounds. The game will speed up, and add obstacles every 10 seconds, twice for every level,
and there are 3 levels. There are 3 sublevels for every level, and thus 9 "levels" overall. Enjoy playing, and good luck!
